### The D Flip-flop
A flip-flop is a device that has two stable states and is used to store state information.
The D flip-flop captures input D and sends it to output Q at the positive or negative edge of the clock.
The D flip-flop modelled in here is triggered by the positive edge of the clock.<br>

### Detailed D Flip-flop
The D Flip-flop is made of a combination of logic gates. One of the combinations is the use of four Nand Gates and a Not Gate. The connections of the gates is as shown in the image below.<br>
