An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational logic circuit that can perform different
arithmetic and bit-wise logical operations on integer binary numbers. ALU is the fundamental
building block of many computing circuits including Central Processing Units (CPUs).
An ALU usually takes two inputs, called operands, and a code, called OPCODE, which specifies
the operation to be performed on the operands. ALU also has a result output which is the result of
the operation on the operands. In some designs, usually the values (operands) fed to the ALU and/or
the result generated from ALU are read from/stored in registers. A general symbolic representation
of an ALU is shown in below.<br>
